# Quiz App

... with a few different tweaks to spice things up.

This is not a serious project. Just a variation of a tutorial I've followed but decided to expand upon by:

-   Building an actual full UI
-   Having multiple pages and setting up Routing
-   Adding mocked additional layers to the quiz game to make it more interesting and challenge myself on the UI side of things.

## üßæ To-do:

-   [x] Set up URL Routing.
-   [x] Build a global scaffold or layout.

    In order to have all pages follow the same structure, as well as sharing the same navbar and footer.

-   [x] Build a Home page.
    -   [ ] Fill with absolute nonsense information just to pretend this is a serious project.
-   [ ] Build an About modal page or pop up.
-   [ ] Set up the Quiz API
-   [ ] Set up a Mock Quiz Ranking
-   [ ] Build a Quiz game page.

    -   [ ] Build a Setup menu for choosing the Quiz type.

        This will involve choosing one of 3 preset quiz settings, or going "endless".

    -   [ ] Build a Ranking modal page with the user score compared to others.
    -   [ ] Add a "Share Score" on social media feature. ü§£

-   [ ] Build an Active User display in the Navbar
    -   [ ] Show an Anonymous account if not logged in. (Mocked)
    -   [ ] Show the User account if logged in. (Mocked)
    -   [ ] Add Log In feature.
    -   [ ] Add Edit Username feature.
    -   [ ] Add Log Out feature.
-   [ ] More?

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è QoL:

-   [ ] Scroll browser to the top when switching pages.
-   [ ] Hide navbar when scrolling up.
-   [ ] Hide navbar when reaching footer.
